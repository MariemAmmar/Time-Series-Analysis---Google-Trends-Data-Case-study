# Time Series Analysis - Google Trends Data
In this project, we will analyze time series data obtained from Google Trends to understand the popularity of various search terms over time. We will focus on three categories: diet, gym, and finance.

## Overview
We will use the following steps to analyze the data:

* Importing necessary packages and the data
* Wrangling the data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Identifying trends and seasonality in time series data

## Steps
### Importing Packages and Data
We will use the following packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. We will also use Jupyter Notebook for our analysis.

We will import the data from a CSV file using the read_csv() function in pandas.

### Wrangling the Data
We will rename the columns and convert the 'Month' column to a datetime object. We will also set the 'Month' column as the index.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
We will plot the data to visualize the trends in the popularity of each search term over time.

### Identifying Trends and Seasonality in Time Series Data
We will use rolling averages to identify trends in the data. We will also check for seasonality in the data.

## Conclusion
By the end of this analysis, we will have a better understanding of the popularity of the search terms 'diet', 'gym', and 'finance' over time. We will also identify any trends and seasonality in the data.
